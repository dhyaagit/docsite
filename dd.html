                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
                    (for example, a web browser),<br>
                    JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
    
                    <P> JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements 
                    such as operators, control structures, and<br> statements
                    . Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example</P>
                    <div class="case1">
                    <P><li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its DocumentObject Model (DOM)
                   . For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse 
                     clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li></P>
                     <p>
                        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server
                   For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of
                     information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file<br> manipulations on a server.</li></p>

                    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                        <div class="case2">
                        <p><li> general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li></p>
                        <p><li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li></p>
                        <p><li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li></p>

                <section id="JavaScript and Java">
                   
                    <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
                    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles
                         Java but does not have Java's static<br> typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, 
                         naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScrip</P>
                        <P> In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on 
                        a small number of data types representing<br> numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object 
                        model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based<br> model provides dynamic inheritance; that 
                        is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative<br>
                         requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods. </P>  
                        <P>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, 
                        and methods. You do not have to be concerned with<br> whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not 
                        have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly<br> typed. </p>

                    <h1>Hello world</h1>
                    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                       <P> <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");</code> </P>
                        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

             <section id="Variables">
             
                    <h1>Variables</h1>
                    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.<br>
                        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case<br> sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).<br>                
                        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some<br> examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.                        
                        </p>
                    
                <section id="Declaring variables">
                    
                     <h1>Declaring variables</h1>
                    <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:<br>
                    With the keyword var. For example,<br>                             <br>  <code> var x = 42.</code><br><br>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br>

                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,<br><br>
                    <code> x= 42.</code><br><br>
                    This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.<br>
                    With the keyword let. For example, <br>    <br>                  
                    <code> let y = 13.</code><br><br>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                                
                    </p>
                
                </section>

                <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
                    <h2>Variable scope</h2>
                    <article>
                      <p>
                        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                        current document. When you declare<br> a variable within a function, it
                        is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                        function.
                      </p>
            
                      <p>
                        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
                        scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
                        function (or global scope) that the<br> block resides within. For
                        example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
                        function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                        block, which<br> in this case is an if statement.
                      </p>
                      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                      <p>
                        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                        ECMAScript 2015.
                      </p>
            
                      <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                        not defined</code>
                    </article>
                  </section>
                  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
                    <h2>Global variables</h2>
                    <article>
                      <p>
                        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                        pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                        variables using the<br> window.variable syntax.
                      </p>
            
                      <p>
                        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
                        or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
                        frame name. For example,<br> if a variable called phoneNumber is
                        declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
                        iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
                      </p>

                    <h2>Constants</h2>

                      <p>
                        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
                        The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                        identifier: it must start with a letter,<br> underscore or dollar sign
                        and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                      </p>
            
                      <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                      <p>
                        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                        while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                      </p>
            
                      <p>
                        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
                        scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
                        assumed to represent a variable.
                      </p>
            
                      <p>
                        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                        variable in the same scope. For example:
                      </p>
            
                      <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS<br>
                        WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;<br>
                        //statements }</code><br><br>
                      However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
                      statement is executed without problems.<br><br>
                      <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                        "otherValue";</code>

                    <h2>Data types</h2>
                    <article>
                      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>
                              null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                              JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                              NULL, or any other variant.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                            </li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>
                              Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                              are unique and immutable.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
            
                        <li>and Object</li>
                      </ul>
                      Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
                      you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
                      functions are the other<br> fundamental elements in the language. You can
                      think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
                      procedures that your application can perform.

                    <h2>if...else statement</h2>
                    <article>
                      Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                      true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
                      condition is false. An if statement<br> looks as follows:<br><br>
            
                      <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code><br><br>
                      condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                      Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                      condition evaluates to true,<br> statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                      statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
                      statement, including further nested if statements.<br>
                      <p>
                        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                        conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                      </p>
                      <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {<br>
                        statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {<br>
                        statement_last; }
                      </code><br><br>
                      In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
                      which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
                      statements, group them within a block<br> statement ({ ... }) . In
                      general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
                      when nesting if statements:<br><br>
            
                      <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br>
                        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {<br>
                        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;<br>
                        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code><br><br>
                      It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
                      expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
                      glancing over the code. For<br> example, do not use the following code:<br><br>
                      <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code><br><br> If you need to use
                      an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                      additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:<br><br>
            
                      <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

                  <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
                    <h2>while statement</h2>
                    <article>
                      A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
                      condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:<br><br>
            
                      <code>while (condition) statement</code><br><br> If the condition becomes
                      false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
                      the statement following the loop.
            
                      <p>
                        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
                        If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
                        condition is tested again. If the condition<br> returns false, execution
                        stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                      </p>
            
                      <p>
                        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
                        group those statements.
                      </p>
            
                      Example:
            
                      <p>
                        The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                      </p>
            
                      <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                      <p>
                        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                        Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                      </p>
            
                      <ul>
                        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                        true, so the loop terminates.
                      </p>

                  <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
                    <h2>Function declarations</h2>
                    <article>
                      A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                      statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
            
                      <ul>
                        <li>The name of the function.</li>
                        <li>
                          A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                          separated by commas.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
                          curly brackets, { }.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        For example, the following code defines a simple function named
                        square:
                      </p>
            
                      <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                      <p>
                        The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                        consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                        function (that is, number)<br> multiplied by itself. The return
                        statement specifies the value returned by the function.
                      </p>
                      <code>return number * number;</code>
                      <p>
                        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                        value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
                        changes the value of the parameter,<br> this change is not reflected
                        globally or in the calling function.
                      </p>
